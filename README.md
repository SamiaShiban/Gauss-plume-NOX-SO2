Dispersion Modeling of Sulfur and Nitrogen Oxides emissions from stationary sources
Power plants and petroleum refineries are important sources of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, which spread to large distances away from their original source. Air pollution modeling widely used to predict concentration of pollutants in relation with operating cases and under various metrological conditions. This study aims to predict the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from two adjacent point sources in Banias: the power plant and petroleum refinery, using MATLAB for analytical solution of 3D advection-dispersion Gaussian equation, to identify the affected area by emissions according to most dominated metrological conditions. Four scenarios were studied for various of metrological conditions in terms of wind speed and direction. The results showed that the main risk was due to Sulphur dioxide emissions, its concentrations exceeded the permission limits for most periods of the year in an area more than 10 square kilometers surrounding the power station and the petroleum refinery. The worst condition has been found to be when the wind direction is south-west, resulting in large area being exposed to the combined impact of the emission of pollutants from both facilities.
